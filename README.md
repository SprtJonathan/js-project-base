## Vanilla project base

### Description

This project aims to provide a simple starter kit for any vanilla JS based projects.
It contains some pre-created folders and a basic HTML/CSS/JS integration.

### Installation

Simply download this repository and paste all its content into your new project folder.

### Usage

You will find a few files pre-configurated.

- The index.html file contains a simple page that includes a button that makes the JS logo image rotate when pressed. You can use this file as a base for your web page.

- The index.js file contains the function that allows the image to rotate on button press.

I organized the files in a way that you can easily add your own code to the project.

- The "public" folder contains two other folders :

  - the Assets folder is used to store every media you want to use on your website.

  - the CSS folder contains all of the stylesheets your website will use.
    To organize your work as effectively as possible, I suggest you to split the CSS code in multiple files and import all of them in the "main.css" file. That way you will be able to find and modify styles much more easily.

Of course feel free to completely change the organization of your own project. The way this project is organized is only a suggestion.
